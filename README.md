This is a simple script that polls your clipboard.
When it detects a line of text with a path and a line number, e.g.

    ReferenceError: get_extra_classes is not defined in /Users/Jesse/Dropbox/CardBrew/03_move/tests/move_test.js (line 25)

it will attempt to open that path at that line in your text editor.

Installation:

  Clone the repo.  Edit the plist file to contain right path.  Then, from the clipmon dir, run launch.sh.
